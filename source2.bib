	abstract = {The spin-boson model, involving spins interacting with a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators, is a widely used representation of open quantum systems. Trapped ions present a natural platform for simulating the quantum dynamics of such models, thanks to the presence of both high quality internal qubit states and the motional modes of the ions that can simulate the relevant quantum degrees of freedom. In our work, we extend the previous body of work that focused on coherent coupling of the spins and bosons to perform quantum simulations with structured dissipative baths using the motional states of trapped ions. We demonstrate the capability for adjusting the bath's temperature and continuous spectral density by adding randomness to fully programmable control parameters. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics of various spin-boson models with noise spectral densities constructed from coupling to several dissipative harmonic oscillator modes. The experimental outcomes closely align with theoretical predictions, indicating successful simulation of open quantum systems using a trapped-ion system.},

We do so by showing how the continuous-time evolution of these master equations arises from discretizing in time the interaction between a system and a probe field and by formulating quantum-circuit diagrams for the discretized evolution. We then reformulate this interaction by replacing the probe field with a bath of qubits, one for each discretized time segment, reproducing all of the standard quantum-optical master equations. This provides an economical formulation of the theory, highlighting its fundamental underlying assumptions.},

Through dedicated sections and a pedagogical approach, we discuss the {CMs} definition and general properties, their use for the derivation of master equations, their connection with quantum trajectories, their application in non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics, their non-Markovian generalizations, their emergence from conventional system–bath microscopic models and link to the input–output formalism. The state of the art of each involved research area is reviewed through dedicated sections. The article is supported by several complementary appendices, which review standard concepts/tools of open quantum systems used in the main text with the goal of making the material accessible even to readers possessing only a basic background in quantum mechanics. The paper could also be seen itself as a friendly, physically intuitive, introduction to fundamentals of open quantum systems theory since most main concepts of this are treated such as quantum maps, Lindblad master equation, steady states, {POVMs}, quantum trajectories and stochastic Schrödinger equation.},

The period of the resulting discrete time crystal is quantized to an integer multiple of the drive period, arising from a combination of collective synchronization and many body localization. Here, we consider a simple model for a one-dimensional discrete time crystal which explicitly reveals the rigidity of the emergent oscillations as the drive is varied. We numerically map out its phase diagram and compute the properties of the dynamical phase transition where the time crystal melts into a trivial Floquet insulator. Moreover, we demonstrate that the model can be realized with current experimental technologies and propose a blueprint based upon a one dimensional chain of trapped ions. Using experimental parameters (featuring long-range interactions), we identify the phase boundaries of the ion-time-crystal and propose a measurable signature of the symmetry breaking phase transition.},

In this system the interplay between incoherent spin pumping and collective emission stabilizes a synchronized non-equilibrium steady state which in the thermodynamic limit features a self-generated time-periodic pattern imposed by collective elastic interactions. In contrast to prior realizations where the time symmetry is already broken by an external drive, here it is only spontaneously broken by the elastic exchange interactions and manifest in the two-time correlation spectrum. Employing a combination of exact numerical calculations and a second-order cumulant expansion, we investigate the impact of many-body correlations on the {TC} formation and establish a connection between the regime where it is stable and where the system features a slow growth rate of the mutual information. This observation allows us to conclude that the {TC} studied here is an emergent semi-classical out-of-equilibrium state of matter. We also confirm the rigidity of the {TC} to single-particle dephasing. Finally, we discuss an experimental implementation using long lived dipoles in an optical cavity.},

This provides a route towards preparing many-body states and non-equilibrium quantum phases by quantum-reservoir engineering. Here, we discuss the example of a driven dissipative Bose–Einstein condensate of bosons and of paired fermions, where atoms in an optical lattice are coupled to a bath of Bogoliubov excitations and the atomic current represents local dissipation. In the absence of interactions, the lattice gas is driven into a pure state with long-range order. Weak interactions lead to a weakly mixed state, which in three dimensions can be understood as a depletion of the condensate, and in one and two dimensions exhibits properties reminiscent of a Luttinger liquid or a Kosterlitz–Thouless critical phase at finite temperature, with the role of the ‘finite temperature’ taken by the interactions.},

	abstract = {Quantum van der Pol oscillators are driven-dissipative systems displaying quantum synchronization phenomena. When forced by a squeezed drive, the frequency adjusts to half of the forcing displaying multiple preferred phases. Here we analyze the physical origin of this entrained response, establishing a connection with metastability in open quantum systems. We report a dynamical regime characterized by a huge separation of time scales, in which a dynamical mode displays a lifetime that can be orders of magnitude larger than the rest. In this regime, the long-time dynamics is captured by an incoherent process between two metastable states, which correspond to the preferred phases of the synchronized oscillator. In fact, we show that quantum entrainment is here characterized by fluctuations driving an incoherent process between two metastable phases, which ultimately limits its temporal coherence when moving into the quantum regime. Finally, we discuss connections with the phenomena of dissipative phase transitions and transient synchronization in open quantum systems.},

While the classical regime has been thoroughly investigated in the past, relatively little is known about the behavior of these nonequilibrium systems in the presence of quantum fluctuations. Here, we theoretically address such a scenario in an open quantum spin model which, in its classical limit, undergoes a directed percolation phase transition. By mapping the problem to a nonequilibrium field theory, we show that the introduction of quantum fluctuations stemming from coherent, rather than statistical, spin flips alters the nature of the transition such that it becomes first order. In the intermediate regime, where classical and quantum dynamics compete on equal terms, we highlight the presence of a bicritical point with universal features different from the directed percolation class in a low dimension. We finally propose how this physics could be explored within gases of interacting atoms excited to Rydberg states.},

The model can improve the storage capacity of discrete neuron-based systems in a large regime and we prove successful state discrimination between 𝑛 coherent states, which represent the stored patterns of the system. These can be tuned continuously by modifying the driving strength, constituting a modified learning rule. We show that the associative-memory capability is inherently related to the existence of a spectral separation in the Liouvillian superoperator, which results in a long timescale separation in the dynamics corresponding to a metastable phase.},

Specifically, we analyze four cases with respect to the configuration about the interactions between atoms and heat baths. Using secular approximation, the conventional master equation usually neglects steady-state coherence, even when the system is coupled with a non-equilibrium environment. When employing the master equation with no secular approximation, we find that the system coherence in our model, denoted by the off-diagonal terms in the reduced density matrix spanned by the eigenvectors of the system Hamiltonian, would survive after a long-time decoherence evolution. The absolute value of residual coherence in the system relies on different configurations of interaction channels between the system and the heat baths. We find that a large steady quantum coherence term can be achieved when the two atoms are resonant. The absolute value of quantum coherence decreases in the presence of additional atom-bath interaction channels. Our work sheds new light on the mechanism of steady-state coherence in microscopic quantum systems in non-equilibrium environments.},

In these phases, the state of the system spontaneously breaks the time-translation symmetry of the dynamical generator, which typically manifests through persistent oscillations of an order parameter. A paradigmatic model displaying such a symmetry breaking is the boundary time crystal, which has been extensively analyzed experimentally and theoretically. Despite the broad interest in these nonequilibrium phases, their thermodynamics and their fluctuating behavior remain largely unexplored, in particular for the case of coupled time crystals. In this work, we consider two interacting boundary time crystals and derive a consistent interpretation of their thermodynamic behavior. We fully characterize their average dynamics and the behavior of their quantum fluctuations, which allows us to demonstrate the presence of quantum and classical correlations in both the stationary and the time-crystal phases displayed by the system. We furthermore exploit our theoretical derivation to explore possible applications of time crystals as quantum batteries, demonstrating their ability to efficiently store energy.},

In this phase, if the system is initially prepared in one of a certain class of pure multispin product states, it periodically returns to this state over very long timescales despite the presence of interactions, disorder, and pulse imperfections. Here, we show that this phase occurs in {GaAs} quantum dot spin arrays containing as few as three quantum dots, each confining one electron spin, for naturally occurring levels of nuclear spin noise and charge noise. Although the physical interaction in these arrays is a nearest-neighbor Heisenberg exchange interaction, we show that this can be effectively converted into an Ising interaction by applying additional pulses during each drive period. We show that by changing the rotation axis of these pulses, we can select the direction of the Ising interaction and, consequently, the quantization axis of the stabilized multispin states. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is possible to perform coherent rotations of the stabilized states while remaining in the time-crystal phase.

	abstract = {The transfer of information between quantum systems is essential for quantum communication and computation. In quantum computers, high connectivity between qubits can improve the efficiency of algorithms, assist in error correction, and enable high-fidelity readout. However, as with all quantum gates, operations to transfer information between qubits can suffer from errors associated with spurious interactions and disorder between qubits, among other things. Here, we harness interactions and disorder between qubits to improve a swap operation for spin eigenstates in semiconductor gate-defined quantum-dot spins. We use a system of four electron spins, which we configure as two exchange-coupled singlet-triplet qubits. Our approach, which relies on the physics underlying discrete time crystals, enhances the quality factor of spin-eigenstate swaps by up to an order of magnitude. Our results show how interactions and disorder in multi-qubit systems can stabilize non-trivial quantum operations and suggest potential uses for non-equilibrium quantum phenomena, like time crystals, in quantum information processing applications. Our results also confirm the long-predicted emergence of effective Ising interactions between exchange-coupled singlet-triplet qubits.},

	abstract = {Time crystals are periodic states exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking in either time-independent or periodically-driven quantum many-body systems. Spontaneous modification of discrete time-translation symmetry in periodically-forced physical systems can create a discrete time crystal ({DTC}) constituting a state of matter possessing properties like temporal rigid long-range order and coherence, which are inherently desirable for quantum computing and information processing. Despite their appeal, experimental demonstrations of {DTCs} are scarce and significant aspects of their behavior remain unexplored. Here, we report the experimental observation and theoretical investigation of {DTCs} in a Kerr-nonlinear optical microcavity. Empowered by the self-injection locking of two independent lasers with arbitrarily large frequency separation simultaneously to two same-family cavity modes and a dissipative Kerr soliton, this versatile platform enables realizing long-awaited phenomena such as defect-carrying {DTCs} and phase transitions. Combined with monolithic microfabrication, this room-temperature system paves the way for chip-scale time crystals supporting real-world applications outside sophisticated laboratories.},

	abstract = {In a periodically driven (Floquet) system, there is the possibility for new phases of matter, not present in stationary systems, protected by discrete time-translation symmetry. This includes topological phases protected in part by time-translation symmetry, as well as phases distinguished by the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry, dubbed “Floquet time crystals.” We show that such phases of matter can exist in the prethermal regime of periodically driven systems, which exists generically for sufficiently large drive frequency, thereby eliminating the need for integrability or strong quenched disorder, which limited previous constructions. We prove a theorem that states that such a prethermal regime persists until times that are nearly exponentially long in the ratio of certain couplings to the drive frequency. By similar techniques, we can also construct stationary systems that spontaneously break continuous time-translation symmetry. Furthermore, we argue that for driven systems coupled to a cold bath, the prethermal regime could potentially persist to infinite time.},

We investigate this in detail in an open quantum spin system, which is a canonical model for the exploration of collective phenomena in strongly interacting dissipative Rydberg gases. Here, a semi-classical approach reveals the emergence of a robust discrete time-crystalline phase in the thermodynamic limit in which metastability, dissipation, and inter-particle interactions play a crucial role. We perform large-scale numerical simulations in order to investigate the dependence on the range of interactions, from all-to-all to short ranged, and the scaling with system size of the lifetime of the time crystal.},

	abstract = {The advent of Beyond 5G (emerging 6G) technologies represents a significant step forward in telecommunications, offering unprecedented data speeds and connectivity. These advances enable a wide range of applications, from enhanced mobile broadband and the Internet of Things to ultra-reliable low-latency communication and the tactical Internet. Thus, having accurate and dependable time synchronization is of utmost importance and plays a critical role in ensuring that all processes function smoothly and effectively. However, existing standards, such as the precision time protocol, are unreliable due to jitters, datagram losses, and complexity. Increasing the synchronization error from the ideal tens of nanoseconds to hundreds of microseconds is unacceptable in future-generation networks. This work provides a novel way to establish ultraprecise synchronization, which is critical for the growth of converged optical communication networks and the 6G era. We investigate quantum non-linear synchronization ({QNS}), which explores the interaction between the non-linear dynamics of atomic systems and dissipation to establish a stable limit-cycle state. In this process, atoms confined within optical resonators are subjected to potential fields, and their spatial motion is synchronized by achieving a stable, phase-locked configuration. By introducing photons into the optical resonators and precisely managing the dissipation effects, it is possible to synchronize multiple optical resonators (referred to as nodes), even in systems with more than three interconnected resonators containing non-linear atoms. To transcend the synchronization signal from the optical setup to communication networks, we propose a distinct mechanism that utilizes the exceptional precision of {QNS} in the optical lattice setup and frequency down-conversion using frequency combs. In addition, it is combined with electronic components such as analog-to-digital converters and field-programmable gate arrays ({FPGAs}) to create synchronized digital signals that are understandable to communication networks. Our method transforms optical pulses into precisely timed electrical signals that can be analyzed and used in sophisticated network systems. We demonstrated that {QNS} and dissipation can synchronize a tri-node clock network to the highest precision of thulium atom-based optical lattice clocks. Our work also highlights the practicality of these applications through {MATLAB} simulations, bridging theoretical principles and real-world solutions with current technology. In our simulations, we utilized an optical signal with a frequency of 263 {THz}, downconverted to a lower microwave frequency of 100 {GHz} to achieve subnanosecond-level synchronized signals. The down-converted signal was subjected to white noise and subsequently digitized. The digital signal was then simulated by sampling rate of \$\$f\_s = 100\$\${GHz} or {GSa}/s (gigasample per second) and limiting the resolution to \$\$b = 8\$\$bits. Finally, high-frequency noise was removed by implementing low-pass filtration using {FPGAs}. This study takes an essential step toward meeting the rising demands for rapid and efficient data transfer in the ever-evolving digital communications landscape, enabling faster and more reliable connectivity for future communication networks and the quantum Internet.},

	abstract = {Current optical atomic clocks do not utilize their resources optimally. In particular, an exponential gain in sensitivity could be achieved if multiple atomic ensembles were to be controlled or read out individually, even without entanglement. However, controlling optical transitions locally remains an outstanding challenge for neutral-atom-based clocks and quantum computing platforms. Here we show arbitrary, single-site addressing for an optical transition via sub-wavelength controlled moves of atoms trapped in tweezers. The scheme is highly robust as it relies only on the relative position changes of tweezers and requires no additional addressing beams. Using this technique, we implement single-shot, dual-quadrature readout of Ramsey interferometry using two atomic ensembles simultaneously, and show an enhancement of the usable interrogation time at a given phase-slip error probability. Finally, we program a sequence that performs local dynamical decoupling during Ramsey evolution to evolve three ensembles with variable phase sensitivities, a key ingredient of optimal clock interrogation. Our results demonstrate the potential of fully programmable quantum optical clocks even without entanglement and could be combined with metrologically useful entangled states in the future.},

Compared to their counterparts with short-ranged interactions, long-range interacting systems display novel physics, such as nonlinear light cones for the propagation of information or inequivalent thermodynamic ensembles. In this work, we consider generic long-range open quantum systems in arbitrary dimensions and focus on the so-called strong long-range regime. We prove that in the thermodynamic limit local properties, captured by reduced quantum states, are described by an emergent noninteracting theory. Here, the dynamics factorizes and the individual constituents of the system evolve independently such that no correlations are generated over time. In this sense, long-range interacting systems are locally noninteracting. This has significant implications for their relaxation behavior, for instance, in relation to the emergence of long-lived quasistationary states or to the absence of thermalization.},
